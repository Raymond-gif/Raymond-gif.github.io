## Education

**[University of California, Irvine](https://engineering.uci.edu/dept/mae)** â€” BS in Aerospace Engineering, GPA: 3.4 [[Degree PDF](/files/AerospaceBS.pdf)]

*June 2024*

## Experience

**Design, Build Fly: Remote-Controlled Aircraft**  
*September 2022 â€” June 2023*
- Measured wing deflection to assess structural integrity after loading the surface with various sand weights  
- Assembled wings by laser cutting and positioning ribs at precise intervals following the analysis of lift/drag curves to determine the ideal airfoil shape  
- Redesigned nose cone shape by experimenting with various lengths and diameters to optimize fineness ratio and minimize parasitic drag

## Projects

**Autonomous Four-Legged Walking Robot Simulating Human Motion**  
*April 2024 â€” June 2024*
- Calibrated weight distribution to ensure center of gravity (CG) was within permitted bounds for control and balance after determining the CG position manually and through SolidWorks (SW) simulation  
- Performed SW motion study analysis to visualize and troubleshoot range of movement and walking mechanism, identifying potential interference issues  
- Tightened joint hole tolerances to improve leg linkages after observing that the leg mechanism was slack, resulting in more natural walking  

**Commercial Aircraft Sizing and Design Report**  
*January 2024 â€” March 2024*
- Hand-calculated the parasitic and induced drag contributions from the wings, tails, and fuselage to determine the ideal flight velocity to minimize drag  
- Coded MATLAB script to size aircraft components, accounting for weight, takeoff lift/drag, thrust available, wing loading, aspect ratio, and sweep angle, in order to meet design requirements  
- Demonstrated sizing results by modeling aircraft on SW and creating detailed drawings of fuselage interior, wings/tails, and landing gear  

**[Supersonic Compressible Fluid Flow Analysis of Diverging Channel](/portfolio/methodofcharacteristics)**  
*September 2024 â€” December 2024*
- Developed a method to compute velocity and pressure fields in arbitrarily shaped channels using lattice point discretization and method of characteristics  
- Coded MATLAB script to determine the geometry of Mach waves and derived Prandtl-Meyer function from Navier-Stokes equations to solve for Riemann invariants. Plotted characteristic lines  
- Determined ideal wall contour shape for isentropic flow (no shocks, cancellation of waves)  


**[Numerical Solution to Falkner-Skan Boundary Layer Equation](/portfolio/numericalmethodsBLeqn/)**  
*January 2025 â€” March 2025*
- Employed a second-order finite difference scheme to solve for flow over flat plate with arbitrary pressure gradient to investigate effects of shear stress on an external body  
- Generated velocity profile plots in MATLAB under successively stronger adverse pressure gradients, capturing the progression toward boundary layer separation  
- Generalized results to flow over any object by using Von Karman momentum integral equations and compared with experimental results found in literature, found close agreement
